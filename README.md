# Legal-Case-Text-Summarization


This project is designed to summarize legal case texts using a variety of algorithms. We have applied five different algorithms: BERT, neural network, TextRank, KL divergence, and SumBasic, and used the ROUGE method to evaluate the quality of the summaries generated by each algorithm.
